The project compares different sorting algorithms and determines the time they take to sort a dataset. Dataset of different sizes were generated and used.

Sorting algorithms that we compared are:
Heap Sort
insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Radix Sort

For smaller dataset, Insertion sort is fastest but as we increase the size of dataset, we concluded that Radix sort is the best one among these four.
